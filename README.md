# CONTENTdm metadata to RDF/XML  

I am using the [XSL transform](CdmToRDFXML.xsl) here to convert metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XML as part of a capstone project for the University of Washington iSchool's MLIS program.  
  
While the XSL file and associated documentation are being shared openly, the [XML metadata files used to be used for the transform](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rjP59ZSyDvuHaCIoyGJ1AYGPtrsKYHtC?usp=sharing) are accessible only to collaborators at the University of Washington.  
  
Much of the information provided here is highly site-specific to transform work with metadata exported from digital collections at the University of Washington.

### Notes
- Many thanks to my project sponsor, Metadata and Cataloging Librarian Theo Gerontakos at the University of Washington Libraries (@gerontakos). He provided essential guidance on mapping of CONTENTdm metadata to RDF properties, XSL work, and the project as a whole.
- This capstone project builds on the work of an iSchool capstone group from 2017 who digitized 40 volumes from the Historical Children's Literature collection. Their excellent work can be seen [here](http://viclit.omeka.net/).
