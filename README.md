# XML2RDFXML  
As part of a capstone project for the University of Washington iSchool MLIS program, the repository collaborators are creating an [XSL transform](CdmToRDFXML.xsl) to convert metadata exported from CONTENTdm in a custom XML format to RDF/XML.  
While the XSL file and associated documentation are being shared openly, the [XML metadata files used to be used for the transform](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rjP59ZSyDvuHaCIoyGJ1AYGPtrsKYHtC?usp=sharing) are accessible only to collaborators at the University of Washington.  
For more information please contact [Ben Riesenberg](mailto:ries07@uw.edu).
