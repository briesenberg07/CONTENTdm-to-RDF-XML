# Overview
This repository was originally built to develop a single XSL transform for converting XML metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XML-serialized RDF data at the **[University of Washington Libraries](http://www.lib.washington.edu/)**. Please see **[the wiki](https://github.com/briesenberg07/contentdmToRdfXml/wiki)** for more details about that particular project.

That original **[transform](DraftXSL/Cdm2RdfXml_01.xsl)** was used to create data describing a few selected items from UW's **[Historical Children's Literature Collection](http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=341698&p=2299537)** (also available as a **[digital collection](http://content.lib.washington.edu/childrensweb/index.html))**. Transform output was used to create a dataset structured primarily using RDF properties available in the **[DPLA MAP](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/metadata-application-profile)**. 

This served as a test for the creation of further RDF data at the UW Libraries, and work is currently taking place within the University of Washington Libraries **[Cataloging and Metadata Services](https://www.lib.washington.edu/msd)** unit to publish data about additional collections. All **[University of Washington Libraries' Semantic Web Data](https://doi.org/10.6069/uwlib.55.a)** is published openly. XSLT scripts and other resources related to this work are made available in the **[University of Washington Libraries Schemas](https://github.com/UniverityOfWashingtonLibrariesSchemas/schemasProject)** repository.
