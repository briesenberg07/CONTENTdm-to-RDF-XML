# CONTENTdm metadata to RDF/XML  
The [XSL transform](Cdm2RdfXml.xsl) here was used to convert metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XML as part of a capstone project for the University of Washington iSchool's MLIS program.  
The [Digital Public Library of America's](https://dp.la/) Metadata Application Profile was invaluable in this project, and served as a template for the creation of a dataset, including files describing source resources, web resources, and aggregations.

### Notes
- Many thanks to my project sponsor, Metadata/Cataloging Librarian Theo Gerontakos at the University of Washington Libraries. He provided essential guidance on mapping of CONTENTdm metadata to RDF properties, XSL work, and the project as a whole.
- This capstone project builds on the work of an iSchool capstone group from 2017 who digitized 40 volumes from the Historical Children's Literature collection. Their excellent work can be seen [here](http://viclit.omeka.net/).
- Much of the information provided here is site-specific to transform work with metadata exported from digital collections at the University of Washington. This is the result of the use of a custom metadata template for CONTENTdm digital collections at UW, as well as other factors.
- The [XML metadata files used for transformation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rjP59ZSyDvuHaCIoyGJ1AYGPtrsKYHtC?usp=sharing) are currently accessible only to collaborators at the University of Washington.
