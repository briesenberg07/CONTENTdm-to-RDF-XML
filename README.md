# Repository Overview
## Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/briesenberg07/CONTENTdm-to-RDF-XML/wiki) for more details
This repository currently hosts two XSL transforms for converting XML metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XML serialized RDF data at the **[University of Washington Libraries](http://www.lib.washington.edu/)**.

The **[first transform](Cdm2RdfXml_01.xsl)** was used to create data describing a few selected items from UW's **[Historical Children's Literature Collection](http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=341698&p=2299537)** (also available as a **[digital collection](http://content.lib.washington.edu/childrensweb/index.html))**. This dataset was constructed primarily using RDF properties available in the **[DPLA MAP](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/metadata-application-profile)**, and served as a test for the creation of further RDF data at the UW Libraries. Documentation regarding the development of the transform and dataset is available **[in the wiki](https://github.com/briesenberg07/CONTENTdm-to-RDF-XML/wiki/Historical-Children's-Literature-Transform-Overview)**.

The **[second transform](Cdm2RdfXml_02.xsl)** is currently being developed to publish data describing the **[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition collection](http://content.lib.washington.edu/aypweb/index.html)**. Documentation regarding this transform is not yet available here.
