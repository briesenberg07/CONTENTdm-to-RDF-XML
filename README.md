This repository currently hosts two XSL transforms for converting XML metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XML serialized RDF data at the **[University of Washington Libraries](http://www.lib.washington.edu/)**.

The [first transform](Cdm2RdfXml_01.xsl) was used to create data describing the **[Historical Children's Literature Collection](http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=341698&p=2299537)** (also available as a **[digital collection](http://content.lib.washington.edu/childrensweb/index.html))**.  

Documentation regarding the development and use of this transform is available **[at the wiki for this repository](https://github.com/briesenberg07/CONTENTdm-to-RDF-XML/wiki/Historical-Children's-Literature-Transform-Overview)**.

The [second transform](Cdm2RdfXml_02.xsl) is currently being developed to describe the **[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition collection](http://content.lib.washington.edu/aypweb/index.html)**. Documentation regarding this transform is not yet available here.
