# XML2RDFXML  
I am creating* and using an [XSL transform](CdmToRDFXML.xsl) to convert metadata exported from CONTENTdm to RDF/XMLAs as part of a capstone project for the University of Washington iSchool MLIS program.  
While the XSL file and associated documentation are being shared openly, the [XML metadata files used to be used for the transform](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rjP59ZSyDvuHaCIoyGJ1AYGPtrsKYHtC?usp=sharing) are accessible only to collaborators at the University of Washington.  
Much of the information provided here is highly site-specific to transform work with metadata exported from digital collections at the University of Washington.

1. Many thanks to Theo G. at the University of Washington Libraries for crucial help with XSL work, mapping of CONTENTdm metadata to RDF properties, and many other aspects of the project.
